<h2>Vegan meatballs</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>  2 cups lentils
 <br>   1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil
 <br>   1 large onion
 <br>   2 carrots
 <br>   2 celery stalks
 <br>   1 garlic clove
 <br>   1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
 <br>   2 teaspoons salt
 <br>   3 tablespoons tomato paste
 <br>   8 ounces button mushrooms, wiped clean and sliced
 <br>   3 large eggs
 <br>   1/2 cup grated rennet-free parmesan cheese
 <br>   1/2 cup bread crumbs
 <br>   1/2cup chopped fresh parsley
 <br>   1/4 cup finely chopped walnuts
</p>
<br>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>1. Combine the lentils and 2 quarts water in a medium stockpot and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the lentils are soft but not falling apart, about 25 minutes. Drain the lentils and allow to cool.

<br>2. Add 1/4 cup of the olive oil to a large frying pan and saute the onions, carrots, celery, garlic, thyme and salt over medium- high heat, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes, until the vegetables are tender and just beginning to brown. Add the tomato paste and continue to cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, for 15 more minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and allow to cool to room temperature.

<br>3. Add the eggs, Parmesan, bread crumbs, parsley and walnuts to the cooled vegetables and mix by hand until thoroughly incorporated. Place in the refrigerator for 25 minutes.

<br>4. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil into a 9- x 13-inch baking dish and use your hand to evenly coat the entire surface. Set aside.

<br>5. Roll the mixture into round, golf ball size meatballs (about 1 1/2 inches), making sure to pack the vegetable mixture firmly. Place the balls in the prepared baking dish, allowing 1/4-inch of space between the balls and in even rows vertically and horizontally to form a grid.

<br>6. Roast for 30 minutes, or until the meatballs are firm and cooked through. Allow the meatballs to cool for 5 minutes in the baking dish before serving.
