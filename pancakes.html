<h2>American Pancakes</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>1 cup milk
<br>1 large egg
<br>2 tbsp melted butter or vegetable oil
<br>1 cup all-purpose flour
<br>2 tsp baking powder
<br>2 tbsp sugar
<br>1 pinch of salt
<br>Assorting toppings such as maple syrup, fresh berries, etc.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>1. Preheat the oven to 90C, with a heatproof platter ready to keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven.
<br>2. In a small bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
<br>3. In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or vegetable oil), and egg.
<br>4. Pour the dry ingredients to the milk mixture, and stir (do not overmix).
<br>5. Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat, and coat generously with vegetable oil.
<br>6. For each pancake, spoon 2 or 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet. Cook until the surface of pancakes have some bubbles, about 1 minute. Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until brown on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more.
<br>7. Transfer to the heatproof platter, cover with foil and keep warm in the oven until serving. Serve warm, with desired topping such as maple syrup, fresh berries or banana slices.
